Question 2: Which is NOT a difference between fork() and clone()
1. clone has flexible sharing of resources, where fork is a complete copy
2. clone may start code in different location, where fork starts from that location
3. clone allows control of the stack, where fork doesn't
4. clone returns 2, where fork only returns once
