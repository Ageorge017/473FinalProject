CHAPTER 3
PROCESS â€“ a program in execution; process execution must progress in sequential fashion.

MULTIPLE PARTS
The program code, also called TEXT SECTION
Current activity including PROGRAM COUNTER, processor registers
STACK containing temporary data such as Function parameters, return addresses, local variables.
DATA SECTION containing global variables
HEAP containing memory dynamically allocated during run time

As a process exectutes it changes STATE -
new - process created
running - instructions are being executed
waiting - the process is waiting for some event to occur
ready - the process is waiting to be assigned to a processesor
terminated - the process has finish executing

PROCESS CONTROL BLOCK contains process state, number, program counter, registers, memory limits, open file list

CHAPTER 4
*********THREADS***********
Threads allow for processes to share resources and memory rather than each process having their own taking up more memory.
USER THREAD: management done by user-level threads library (pthread
KERNEL THREAD: Supported by the Kernel

MULTITHREADING MODELS: Many-to-one, one-to-one, many-to-many
Many-to-one: many user level threads mapped to single kernel thread. One thread blocking causes all to block. Multiple threads may not run in parallel on muticore system because only one may be in kernel at a time.
One-to-one: Each user-level thread maps to kernel thread. More concurrency than many-to-one. Number of threads per process sometimes restricted due to overhead.
Many-to-many: Allows many user level threads to be mapped to many kernel threads. Allows the  operating system to create a sufficient number of kernel threads.

*********SIGNAL HANDLING***********
SIGNALS are used in UNIX systems to notify a process that a particular event has occurred.
SIGNAL HANDLER is used to process signals.
Signal generated by particular event, delivered to a process, and handled by one of two signal handlers: default or user-defined which may overwrite default handler.

CHAPTER 6
*********PROCESS SCHEDULING***********
PROCESS SCHEDULER selects among available processes for next execution on CPU

BASIC CONCEPTS
SHORT-TERM SCHEDULER selects from among the processes inready queue, and allocates the CPU to one of them
CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process: (NONPREEMPTIVE)
    1.Switches from running to waiting state (NONPREEMPTIVE)
    2.Switches from running to ready state (PREEMPTIVE)
    3.Switches from waiting to ready (PREEMPTIVE)
    4.Terminates (NONPREEMPTIVE)

SCHEDULING CRITERIA
CPU utilization, Throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, response time
For optimizing CPU utilization, Throughput should be maximized and the rest should be minimized

ALGORITHMS
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE (FCFS) - nonpremptive. executes queued processes in order of arrival. Ineffecient Throughput since short processes at the end of queue have to wait for longer process to finish.
SHORTEST JOB FIRST (SJF) - associate each process by its CPU burst. Optimal, gives minimum average waiting time. Large processes are starved.
SHORTEST REMAINING TIME FIRST - preemptive SJF
PRIORITY SCHEDULING - associating a priority number to each process. preemptive and nonpremptive. Lower priority processes may be starved. Solution is  AGING - as time progresses increase priority.
ROUND ROBIN - each process is alloted a certain amount of time to run after which the process is preempted and added to the end of ready queue.

*********SYSTEM CALLS***********
see man pages for system calls
fork(), exec(), exit(), wait(), abort(), pthread_create(), pthread_cancel()
