CHAPTER 7
*********MAIN MEMORY***********
Program must be brought (from disk)  into memory and placed within a process for it to be run. Forms an input queue.
Memory unit only sees a stream of addresses + read requests, or address + data and write requests.
Main memory can take many cycles, causing a STALL. CACHE sits between main memory and CPU registers.
Protection of memory required to ensure correct operation. BASE and LIMIT registers define the logical address space.

Binding of Instructions and Data to Memory
Compile time:  If memory location known a priori, absolute code can be generated; must recompile code if starting location changes.
Load time:  Must generate relocatable code if memory location is not known at compile time.
Execution time:  Binding delayed until run time if the process can be moved during its execution from one memory segment to another. (Hardware support required).

Logical vs. Physical Address Space
LOGICAL: Generated by the CPU (Virtual address).
PHYSICAL: address seen by the memory unit.

*********LINKING***********
STATIC LINKING – system libraries and program code combined by the loader into the binary program image.
DYNAMIC LINKING –linking postponed until execution time.
Small piece of code, STUB, used to locate the appropriate memory-resident library routine. Stub replaces itself with the address of the routine, and executes the routine. Operating system checks if routine is in processes’ memory address. If not in address space, add to address space.

*********SWAPPING***********
A process can be SWAPPED temporarily out of memory to a backing store, and then brought back into memory for continued execution.

*********MEMORY ALLOCATION***********
HOLE – block of available memory; holes of various size are scattered throughout memory.
When a process arrives, it is allocated memory from a hole large enough to accommodate it. Process exiting frees its partition, adjacent free partitions combined. 

Satisfying a request of size n from a list of free holes:
FIRST FIT - Allocate the first hole that is big enough.
BEST FIT - Allocate the smallest hole that is big enough; must search entire list, unless ordered by size. Produces the smallest leftover hole
WORST FIT - Allocate the largest hole; must also search entire list. Produces the largest leftover hole.
First-fit and best-fit better than worst-fit in terms of speed and storage utilization.

*********FRAGMENTATION***********
EXTERNAL FRAGMENTATION – total memory space exists to satisfy a request, but it is not contiguous.
INTERNAL FRAGMENTATION – allocated memory may be slightly larger than requested memory; this size difference is memory internal to a partition, but not being used.
Reduce external fragmentation by COMPACTION. Shuffle memory contents to place all free memory together in one large block.

*********PAGING***********
Physical  address space of a process can be noncontiguous; process is allocated physical memory whenever the latter is available. Avoids external fragmentation.
Divide physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called FRAMES. Divide logical memory into blocks of same size called PAGES. 

ADDRESS TRANSLATION
Divided into PAGE NUMBER – used as an index into a page table which contains base address of each page in physical memory and PAGE OFFSET – combined with base address to define the physical memory address that is sent to the memory unit.
TRANSLATION LOOK-ASIDE BUFFER (TLB) - is a memory cache that is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location. Stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory.
